read the files. read README.md ps.md 

and the files, i have build a prototype whihc works fine as a webapp.



but problem is i need to upload the log files which dont make it a live monitoring system.



so we have frontned runing, backend running python.

can we have a srerver/service that mock live log of /sample-logs.

so it output logs one by one. and backend read it and so on fronend .



it should be real time on fontend tooo.
